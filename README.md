*UPDATED  TO REFLECT CHANGES IN v1.1.3

# Hype Symbol Override Extension
 Override Symbol Instance Properties

 ![ExtensionHeadImage](README.assets/ExtensionHeadImage.jpg)

This Extension will run on Symbol Load (*HypeSymbolLoad*).



Although Hype Symbol instances share all the same HTML properties, child elements , timelines etc.

It is often the case that you want each Symbol's instance to use different parameters when they appear on scene.

For example you may be using a Symbol to display images and text but want different images and text in each.. 

<hr>

This extension gives you a way to easily override many of a Symbol instance's child element's perameters/properties.



*Four instances of a single Symbol on a Scene.*

<hr>
Download the **symbolOverride.js**  file above and place it you Hype Projects resources via the Resources panel.

The extension will run on each Symbol at using the On Symbol load. You do not need to edit function  or use an action for this to happen.							

**Have a Look at the [Quick Start page](https://markhunte.github.io/Hype_Symbol_Override_Extension/) to see how it works.**
