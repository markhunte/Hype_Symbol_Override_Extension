This Extension will run on Symbol Load (*HypeSymbolLoad*).



Although Hype Symbol instances share all the same HTML properties, child elements , timelines etc.

It is often the case that you want each Symbol's instance to use different parameters when they appear on scene.

For example you may be using a Symbol to display images and text but want different images and text in each.. 

<hr>

This extension gives you a way to easily override many of the Symbol instance's properties.



*Four instances of a single Symbol on a Scene.*

With the Extension and on Symbol load.

<hr>


 Individual Symbol instance properties can be overriden to allow each instance of the symbol to  be displayed differently and behave differently from each other at load time.



Each Symbol Instance **child element** can be assigned dataset key names  [***data-bindingName***] and [**Property**] names. 

When the Parent  **Symbol Instance element**  has the matching ***data-bindingName*** and given a **value** the child element will use the **value** to overide it's targeted  **property**

Each *data-bindingName*  must only be used per child element. Any child element must have its own unique dataset key name.

For example You want to chnage the Left and Top of ***Rectangle 1*** and **Rectangle 2**.

You could use the *data-bindingName*s.

**data-rect1left**,  ***data-rect1top***

and

**data-rect2left**, ***data-rect2top***



The names are entirely up to you but should reflect the target element and property name for easy understanding when looking at it at a later time.

The overriden properties can be normal css properties, hypeDocument.setElementProperty() properties or other HTML properties that can normally be set with javascript.

A Symbol Instance is an instance of a single Symbol on a scene and there can be many instances of the same Symbol on a scene.

You only have to set up the Symbol and its children elements once but you can add a new data-bindingName  and value at any time.

 A Symbol's child elements may have data-bindingNames and values  but the Symbol Parent itself does not have to ;  have , use any or all of them.
An Element's data-bindingName  is to be used, must the matching data-bindingName  in the Parent Symbol



<hr>

####  Symbol instance element:  data-bindingName: `value`



*How Symbol **data-bindingNames** and **values** are used for an override from the parent Symbol Instance.*

The data-bindingNames  and values are entered  in the **Additional HTML Attributes** in Hype's Identity Panel as shown here

###### data-bindingName



**data-**    : All names must start with this.

**bindingName** : The arbitry name you give to refence an element. this does not have to match any real id you have given to the element.  But should reflect in some part the symbols target child element and real world property name so its intent is clear.

**value**  			:  The property value to pass in for the override.

**duration** 		:   The duration value for a hype API setElementProperty. 

This comes after the value and is separated by a comma. 

The duration value is here for completeness in reflection the the setElementProperty API

In most cases you will do any animaions on elements using the normal means with in hype.

But adding a duration here will also allow for the same type of animation afforded to using the setElementProperty in an Hype function.

#### Symbol instance  > **Child elements**  : **data-bindingName  : property**



How Child Element's **data-bindingNames** and **property** names are used to ACCEPT an override from the parent Symbol Instance

The data-bindingNames  and property names are entered  in the **Additional HTML Attributes** in Hype's Identity Panel as shown here



<img src="README.assets/Screenshot 2021-01-28 at 22.48.54.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-28 at 22.48.54" style="zoom:50%;" />

<hr>

An element's **data-bindingName**  Must match a Parent Symbol's  *data-bindingName*  

 

**style** 						 :  Add 'style' property name at the beginning using (.) syntax, if the target property is a native css property. ***Do not use it for Hype 's setElementProperty API properties***. 

**property** 	                     :  This value should be the real a Hype 's *setElementProperty* API property names ,a css property name or other HTML property name you wish to target. 



**value** 	                     :  This value should be the real Hype *setElementProperty* API property names , a real css property name or other real HTML property name you wish to target.

**Error handling.**

An error will occur if there is a mismatch in the *data-bindingName  being used.

An error will be thrown in the console giving details and info to help find the mismatch.
 	Data for each error overide in a Symbol instance will be shown.<br>
 	**Symbol ID**<br>
 	**Mismatched *data-bindingName***<br>
 	**Completed overrides** data-bindingnames and values accepted  by the children elements<br>
 	**Expected overrides sent from** the Symbol to the children elements<br>

**print_debug** 

If **print_debug**  is on ( set to **true** ) The console will give the following data.

This is handy if you are not getting the values where you expect.

  Data for each fully Completed overide for a Symbol instance will be shown.<br>
 	**Symbol ID**<br>
 	**Completed override** data-bindingnames and values accepted by the children elements<br>
 	**Expected overrides sent from** the Symbol to the children elements<br>

You can also change  **print_debug**  to **false**  to turn it off
